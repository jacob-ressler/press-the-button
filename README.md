# Press The Button

Just press the button, how hard can it be?

This is an EXTREMELY rudimentary JavaFX application. The goal is to press the on-screen button 10 times as quickly as possible. After each press, it moves to a random location in the window. A final time for the round is displayed after the last button press.

## Getting started

### **Download and Usage from JAR**

Executable JAR files for all versions are available under the `_releases` directory. To always get the most recent version, click [here](<https://github.com/jacob-ressler/press-the-button/raw/master/_releases/CoinFlipSim(v1.0).jar>).

To launch the application, simply double-click the file. The following command can also be used to launch the application from a terminal:

```bash
java -jar "PressTheButton(v1.0).jar"
```

_**Note** that the version number in the command should be identical to version number of the JAR file you have downloaded for it to work properly._

### **Building from Source**

After downloading the `src` folder, use the following command to generate the class files:

```bash
javac ButtonGame.java
```

To launch the application, use the command:

```bash
java ButtonGame
```
